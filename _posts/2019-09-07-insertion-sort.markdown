Keyword: Comparative Soring, Algorithm

Insertion Sort is similar to how we sorted cards in our hand when playing card games. Each card (element) is compared with the cards before it in the array/list and moved to left of the least card (element) that is larger than it. 

This graphical example clearly illustrates the sorting process:
